Focused on clean, modern styling to enhance user experience.  




## Milestone 3 Summary

## 1. Installed Necessary Dependencies
Set up essential Node.js packages such as express for handling server requests, dotenv for managing environment variables, mongoose for database interaction, and nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.

## 2. Organized Backend Structure
Created a structured backend setup by adding index.js as the main entry point for the server and db.js to manage the database connection, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

## 3. Server Setup with Environment Variables
Developed a server that listens on a specified port, using values from an .env file to maintain flexibility and security in configuration settings.

## 4. Integrated MongoDB for Data Storage
Connected the backend to a MongoDB database using mongoose, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of application data.

## 5. Verified Server-Database Connection
Successfully confirmed the connection between the server and MongoDB, ensuring smooth data transactions between the backend and the database.

## 6. Implemented Basic Error Handling
Added error-handling mechanisms to manage potential issues, improving the stability and reliability of the backend system.







## Milestone 3 Summary

## 1. Created a User Model
Designed a schema using Mongoose to define how user data (e.g., name, email, password) will be structured and stored in MongoDB.

## 2. Created a User Controller
Developed functions to handle user-related operations, such as adding new users and retrieving user data, ensuring proper request handling and responses.

## 3. Enabled and Configured Multer
Integrated Multer middleware to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload and store files (such as profile pictures) efficiently.







## Milestone 4 Summary

## 1Ô∏è. Built the Sign-Up Page
Designed a responsive Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean and structured layout. Used TailwindCSS for styling consistency.

## 2Ô∏è. Added Form Validation
Implemented client-side validation to prevent empty submissions, enforce valid email formats, and ensure password security.

## 3Ô∏è. Defined Routes for Authentication Pages
Configured React Router to enable seamless navigation between the Login and Sign-Up pages.

This milestone ensures a user-friendly authentication flow with validation and smooth routing. üöÄ








## Milestone 6: 
In this milestone, I focused on enhancing security in the user authentication process. The key improvements include:

## 1. Password Encryption: 
Implemented bcrypt to hash user passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring sensitive credentials are not saved in plain text.

## 1.Secure Data Storage: 
Successfully saved complete user details (username, email, and encrypted password) in the database while maintaining security best practices.

These implementations strengthen the overall security of user authentication, preventing unauthorized access and enhancing data protection.










## Milestone 7 Summary
In this milestone, we implemented a complete login system with secure password verification:

## 1.Login Endpoint Implementation
Created secure login endpoint at /users/login.
Added user verification against database records.
Implemented proper error handling for non-existent users.
Password Verification System.

## Password Validation
Integrated bcrypt for secure password comparison
Implemented password hash comparison with stored credentials
Added secure error messages to prevent user enumeration
Login Response Handling
